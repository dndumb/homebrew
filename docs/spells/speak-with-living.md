You touch a willing creature, granting it the charm and social confidence of an extrovert.
If the creature you choose has a Charisma of 14 or higher or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

For the duration, the target becomes more outgoing, articulate, and sociable, experiencing a heightened sense of ease and enjoyment in social interactions.

Until the spell ends, the target's Charisma can't be less than 16, and they gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks.

The target feels more comfortable in social settings, able to initiate conversations and engage with others effortlessly, and has a heightened sense of humor and wit, making them more entertaining and likable to others.

This spell does not alter the target's fundamental personality or values but temporarily amplifies their extroverted traits. 
Once the spell ends, the target reverts to their normal demeanor and may remember the experience with clarity.
