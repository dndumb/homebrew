*4th-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: self
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pussy hair)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
Sniff the pussy hair. You sense the direction to the hot bitch’s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. 

If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a hot bitch, as long as the bitch is hot for your standard. If the hot bitch you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn’t locate the creature.

This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature, or if the creature has produced running blood from their private parts during the last 24 hours.
