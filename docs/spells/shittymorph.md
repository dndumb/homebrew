# Shittymorph

_4th-level transmutation_ \
**Casting Time**: 1 action \
**Range**: 60 feet \
**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of poop) \
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a non-magical shit. The transformation
lasts for the duration. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is
dispelled.

This spell has no effect on a shape-changer or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom
saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.

The creature transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into a pile of shit. The creature's statistics
become those of the shit, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns
to its normal form.
