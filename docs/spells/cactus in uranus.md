---
A creature of your choice must make a Constitution Saving throw. A creature gets 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
If the throw is failed, the creature must spend an action to remove the cactus from his/her anus or get 1d8 piercing damage at the start of every turn.
After 1d4 turns with the cactus inside, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw; on a failed save, he turns gay if he is a male straight creature, otherwise the creature becomes a nymphomaniac. 

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

**Spell lists.** Bard, Warlock and Druid.
