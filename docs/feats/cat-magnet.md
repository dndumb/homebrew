# Cat Magnet

_Prerequisite: None_

Cats are extremely attracted to you, and when you sit down a cat will always appear to sit on your lap.

**Benefits**:

- **Feline Affinity**: You gain advantage on any check to interact with a cat. This includes Animal Handling,
  Persuasion, and even Performance checks if they involve cats.
- **Purr-fect Comfort**: While a cat is on your lap, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
- **Silent Step**: Mimicking the graceful movements of a cat, you gain proficiency in Stealth. If you are already
  proficient, you can add double your proficiency bonus to Stealth checks.
- **Curiosity**: Once per long rest, you can call upon a nearby cat to scout an area for you. This cat has the
  statistics of a common cat, can understand your instructions, and will report back what it sees within a range of 100
  feet.

**Drawbacks**:

- **Cat Distraction**: If a cat is present and you are not actively interacting with it, you have disadvantage on
  Perception checks due to the constant distraction of their presence.
- **Cat Allergy**: If you somehow become allergic to cats, you lose all benefits of this feature until the allergy is
  cured.
