### Fatso

**Prerequisite:** Your character must weigh at least 180 pounds.

You have disadvantage on all Athletics checks.

**Sweat Creation:**

You can produce sweat that you can use to create Molotov cocktails. Each day, roll 1d4 to determine the number of Molotov cocktails you can create that day. To create a Molotov cocktail, you need a container and must spend 1 hour collecting sweat. During the summer, this time is reduced to 10 minutes.

**Molotov Cocktail:**

The power of your Molotov cocktails increases at 5th, 11th, and 17th character levels as shown below.

| Weapon             | Damage                              | Weight | Properties                           |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Molotov (1st level) | 1d10 fire damage + 1d4 per turn     | 1 lb.  | Light, thrown (30/60 ft.), special   |
| Molotov (5th level) | 1d12 fire damage + 1d6 per turn     | 1 lb.  | Light, thrown (30/60 ft.), radius (5 ft.), special   |
| Molotov (11th level)| 2d12 fire damage + 1d8 per turn     | 1 lb.  | Light, thrown (30/60 ft.), radius (15 ft.), special  |
| Molotov (17th level)| 2d12 fire damage + 2d8 per turn     | 1 lb.  | Light, thrown (30/60 ft.), radius (20 ft.), special  |

**Special Effect:**

When you throw a Molotov cocktail, all creatures within the radius (dependent on your level) must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes the full damage and begins burning for 1d4 rounds (1d6 rounds at 5th level). On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not begin burning.
