# Italian Speaker

_Prerequisite: Spellcasting abilities_

From now on you can replace the Verbal components of your spells with the Italian gesture ðŸ¤Œ. \
This allows you to cast spells without speaking, but **you must have a free hand to do so**. \
In particular, this feat can't be used on spells that require a Somatic component. \
**The gesture is not subtle** and can be easily noticed by anyone who can see you.
