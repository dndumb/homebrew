##### Loading

Because of the time required to load this weapon,
you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action,
or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

##### Range

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.
The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target
beyond the weapon’s long range.
