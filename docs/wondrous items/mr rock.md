# Mr. Rock

_Wondrous Item (Requires Attunement)_

Mr. Rock is a rock with a smile drawn on it with some kind of paint (the color is chosen by the DM).

It increases by 1 the number of items you can attune to, but uses an attunement slot.

Mr. Rock is sentient and will speak with you, but you are the only person who can hear him.
