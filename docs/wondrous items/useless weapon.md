### Useless Weapon

_Weapon (any weapon), rare (requires attunement)_

This weapon is crafted from a mysterious and somewhat comical magic plastic, giving it an unusual sheen and a peculiar weightlessness. Despite its bizarre appearance, the Useless Weapon is imbued with potent enchantments.

- **Exceptional Precision:** You gain a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- **Forced Excellence:** When you attack with this weapon, you must use your highest stat modifier for both the attack and damage rolls.
- **Unwavering Confidence:** You have advantage on attack rolls when using this weapon.

However, the Useless Weapon's true nature reveals itself in failure:
- **Ironic Curse:** The weapon's magical effects only activate when you miss an attack. Upon missing, a burst of chaotic energy is released, causing one of the following effects (roll 1d8 to determine):

    1. **Loud Clatter:** The weapon emits a deafening clatter, causing all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.
    2. **Humiliating Display:** A burst of bright, colorful sparks explodes from the weapon, drawing attention and making you the center of ridicule. All creatures within 30 feet have advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.
    3. **Slippery Surface:** The ground around you becomes extremely slippery, causing all creatures (including yourself) within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
    4. **Unpredictable Bounce:** The weapon bounces out of your hand and lands 10 feet away in a random direction.
    5. **Static Shock:** The weapon releases a jolt of static electricity, causing you and all creatures within 5 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 lightning damage.
    6. **Laughing Fit:** A wave of uncontrollable laughter affects you and all creatures within 15 feet. Each affected creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, laughing hysterically, for 1 minute. This effect ends if the creature takes damage.
    7. **Blinding Flash:** A bright flash of light erupts from the weapon, causing all creatures within 20 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
    8. **Confounding Echo:** The weapon emits a loud, echoing noise that confuses all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of your next turn.
